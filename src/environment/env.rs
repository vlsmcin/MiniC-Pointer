//! The `Environment<V>` type: a name-to-value binding map.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [`Environment<V>`] is a flat `HashMap` from `String` (a name) to `V` (a
//! value). It supports the four core operations needed by both the type
//! checker and the interpreter:
//!
//! * [`declare`](Environment::declare) — bind a new name (or overwrite).
//! * [`get`](Environment::get) — look up a name.
//! * [`set`](Environment::set) — update an existing binding.
//! * [`snapshot`](Environment::snapshot) / [`restore`](Environment::restore)
//!   — save and restore the entire map (used for scoping).
//!
//! Additionally, [`names`](Environment::names) and
//! [`remove_new`](Environment::remove_new) support block-exit cleanup.
//!
//! # Design Decisions
//!
//! ## A single generic struct serving two phases
//!
//! In Rust, `Environment<V>` is *generic* over `V` — the angle brackets mean
//! "this struct works for any type `V` you choose". The same struct is used
//! with `V = Type` in the type checker and `V = Value` in the interpreter.
//! This avoids duplicating identical HashMap logic in two places, and ensures
//! that both phases have the same scoping behaviour.
//!
//! An alternative would have been two separate structs (`TypeEnv` and
//! `ValueEnv`). That was rejected because the two environments really do have
//! identical structure — only the stored type differs.
//!
//! ## Flat map with snapshot/restore instead of a scope stack
//!
//! A common approach to scoping is a *stack of maps*: push a new map on
//! block entry, pop it on block exit. MiniC uses a different approach: a
//! single flat `HashMap` combined with full-clone snapshots.
//!
//! * **Function calls**: before a call, the entire map is cloned
//!   (`snapshot`). The callee's parameters and locals are declared directly
//!   in the map. After the call returns, the map is replaced with the saved
//!   clone (`restore`). This gives each function call a completely fresh
//!   scope while still being able to look up functions defined at the
//!   top level.
//!
//! * **Block statements**: on block entry, [`Environment::names`] records the set of
//!   currently bound names. On block exit, [`Environment::remove_new`] removes any name
//!   that was not in that set — i.e., any variable declared inside the block.
//!   Assignments to outer-scope variables are *not* undone, which is the
//!   correct behaviour (a loop counter updated inside a `while` body must
//!   persist after the body finishes).
//!
//! The flat-map approach is simpler to implement and reason about for a small
//! language. The cost — cloning the entire map on each function call — is
//! acceptable at MiniC's scale.
